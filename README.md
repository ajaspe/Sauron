# Sauron Productivity Monitoring Tool

This little Windows tools intends to keep track of what windows
you keep in foreground, idle time, etc. in order to compute some
stats of how you spend your time.

~~Under development~~

**UPDATE: PROJECT CANCELLED**
There is another open source project doing *exactly* the same: [Procrastitraker](http://www.procrastitracker.com/)
